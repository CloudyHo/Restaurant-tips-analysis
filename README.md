# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Tips Analysis
## Project description
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.
## Source of the data 
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

Then load data from the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv
## The main goal
Provide insights by comparing tip amount different dimensional variables such as: smoker, non-smoker, gender, day and time in day.
## Results

1. Most tips from customers range from 4-5 USD.
2. Non-smokers are more generous tippers than smokers, both in frequency and amount.
